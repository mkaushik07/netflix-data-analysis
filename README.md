## Technologies Used

* **SQL:** For data extraction and analysis.
* **MySQL:** As the database management system.

## Conclusion
This project not only enhanced my SQL skills but also deepened my understanding of data analysis methodologies. I look forward to leveraging these skills in real-world applications and contributing to data-driven decision-making processes.
